# Coordinate System

This project uses the same right-angled “Cartesian” coordinate system with the Z axis pointing upwards as the coordinate system used in [Blender](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.91/editors/3dview/navigate/viewpoint.html).

Camera space (view space) coordinate are defined with positive x axis points to the right, positive y axis points upwards, and positive z axis points backward.
